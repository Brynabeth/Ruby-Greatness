            <h2 class="sectiontext">Precious, thoughtful gifts</h2>
            <p class="sectiontext">Ruby is so thoughtful in gift giving. It could be the most random thing, but no matter what it is, the gift is always relevant! Each gift makes me feel supported and loved. I love her regardless of the gifts, but I'm very grateful for each of them. I wish I was so gifted at gifting haha. She's awesome.</p>

            <h2 class="sectiontext">Words of encouragement</h2>
            <p class="sectiontext">Anytime I'm in a bad mood or sad, Ruby makes me feel better. I remember especially in the beginning when we worked together two summers ago. She started leaving me snippets of delightul encouragements, reminding me of my worthfulness. And I think I needed that a lot. I can have some pretty insecure thinking of myself if that wasnt obvious haha. She's really helped me have a better mindset about myself. I hope I have helped her do the same. Because she's truly amazing. </p>

            <h2 class="sectiontext">Straightforward advice</h2>
            <p class="sectiontext">Sometimes I'm not good at looking at things objectively, but she's good at putting things into a realistic perspective. And she tells me what I need to do, even if it's not what I want to do. She's smart... but bruh she calls her smartness common sense. But idc about that. I'm not very down-to-earth, so it's nice to hear her perspective and advice.</p>

            <p class="sectiontext">This doesn't need much of an explanation because it's pretty self-explanatory. I love her hugs lol. They're my favorite haha. Her hugs give me security and comfort. She's awesomeee.</p>

            <h2 class="sectiontext">Methodical mind</h2>
            <p class="sectiontext">Ruby has such a methodical mind. This goes back to her logical perspective of things. I realy like her perspective because it always reveals something I never thought of. She's also a pretty hard worker. But, she wouldn't say that about herself. She would say something like, "Well, I'm just doing my job." But she's fast and efficient. It's impressive!</p>

            <h2 class="sectiontext">Smile and humor</h2>
            <p class="sectiontext">Ruby is hilarious lol. She cracks me up so much sometimes hehe. She might call her humor basic, but it's still funny lolol. Her friend Sarah said that her laugh is just as funny as her jokes, and I agreeee. Her smile is so sweet and cute and it makes me smile. I love itt.</p>
